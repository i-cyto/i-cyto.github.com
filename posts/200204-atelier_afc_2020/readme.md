Atelier AFC 2020
================

During this training, we used the cytofkit package with the following [Graphical User Interface](cytofkit_GUI.png).

You can simplify the selecion of markers by using a [text file](ck_markers_main.txt) of the markers to analyze. Just type this file name into the marker selection field.

Then it's possible to continue the analysis with cytofast. Here is the [html](JT_AFC_2020.html) resulting from the data exported from cytofkit (or cytosplore). You need to define sample groups in a [meta.csv file](meta.csv). Then you get nice heatmaps, compute t-test of percentages and Volcano plots.
