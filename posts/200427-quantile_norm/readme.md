Quantile Normalisation
================

I analyzed the quantile normalisation pros and cons as implemented in [cytoNorm](https://github.com/saeyslab/CytoNorm) and [CytofBathAdjust](https://github.com/CUHIMSR/CytofBatchAdjust).
The analysis is available as a [HTML document](quantile_norm.html) with R commands or just as a R Markdown [script](quantile_norm.Rmd).

CytofBatchAdjust has been adapted to run on Windows [here](https://github.com/i-cyto/CytofBatchAdjust).
